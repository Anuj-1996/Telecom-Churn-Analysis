# Telecom-Churn-Analysis
Analyze the data to discover key factors responsible for customer churn

Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) is a method for analysing data. The first and most important responsibility of a data scientist is to examine the data and give us a better understanding of it. Later, we decide what questions to ask and how to use the data and information to acquire the interpretations we require.

EDA enables us to:</br>
1) Investigate the data set and the connections between the variables </br>
2) Identify any noteworthy observations </br>
3) Create a rough outline of potential relationships between the predictors and the target variable </br>

Exploratory data analysis provided us with the following insights regarding the Churn data set:</br>


-The area code, state, total day, evening and night calls features are unnecessary and can be removed.</br>
-The remaining features variables have modest correlations, allowing us to keep them all.</br>
-Increasing calling Minutes and Charges have direct correaltionship with customer churn.</br>
-Customers on the International Plan churn at a higher rate.</br>
-Customers who have made four or more customer support calls churn four times as frequently as other customers.</br>
